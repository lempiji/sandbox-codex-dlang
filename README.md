# sandbox-codex-dlang

This repository is a playground for exploring D language features.
Each topic should be placed in its own subdirectory under `topics/`.
Use `dub` or `dmd` as needed.

Individual examples live under `topics/` and each one contains its own
`README.md` describing what the sample demonstrates.
